   is a string instrument that has
  existed since the Byzantine Empire.
  It sounds like a bagpipe, but has no strings,
  and creates sound via a rotating wheel.
  The earliest form of the hurdy gurdy was an instrument called an "organistrum".

The <a href="https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/flute/play/"> flute</a>
  is a woodwind instrument, except it does not contain reeds, like the saxophone or clarinet.
  Therefore, it is considered an aerophone, or reedless wind instrument
  It has existed for up 43,000 to 35,000 years ago, and has been found in the Swabian Jurian region of present day <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany">Germany.</a>
  The flute uses keys and breath from the player to create different notes, which range from A to G.
  There are many variations of flutes, including side-blown and end-blown varieties. However, the most common flute is the Western Concert flute.
  Below is another diagram for the components of said flute, as well as a chart for fingering notes, for those
  who are interested.
